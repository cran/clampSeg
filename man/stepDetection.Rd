\title{Detection of steps / jumps by a multiresolution criterion}
\description{Implements the detection step of \acronym{JULES} (\cite{Pein et al.}, 2018, Section III-A) which consists of a fit by a multiresolution criterion computed by a dynamic program and a postfilter step that removes incremental steps. This initial fit (reconstruction) can then be refined by local deconvolution implemented in \code{\link{deconvolveLocally}} to obtain \acronym{JULES}, also implemented in \code{\link{jules}}.\cr
If \code{q == NULL} a Monte-Carlo simulation is required for computing the critical value. Since a Monte-Carlo simulation lasts potentially much longer (up to several hours or days if the number of observations is in the millions) than the main calculations, the package saves them by default in the workspace and on the file system such that a second call that require the same Monte-Carlo simulation will be much faster. For more details, in particular to which arguments the Monte-Carlo simulations are specific, see Section \cite{Storing of Monte-Carlo simulations} below. Progress of a Monte-Carlo simulation can be reported by the argument \code{messages} and the saving can be controlled by the argument \code{option}, both can be specified in \code{\dots} and are explained in \code{\link{getCritVal}}.

\usage{
stepDetection(data, filter, q = NULL, alpha = 0.05, sd = NULL, startTime = 0,
              output = c("onlyFit", "everything"), ...)
}

\arguments{
\item{data}{a numeric vector containing the recorded data points}
\item{filter}{an object of class \code{\link{lowpassFilter}} giving the used analogue lowpass filter}
\item{q}{a single numeric giving the critical value q in (\cite{Pein et al.}, 2018, (7)), by default chosen automatically by \code{\link{getCritVal}}}
\item{alpha}{a probability, i.e. a single numeric between 0 and 1, giving the significance level to compute the critical value \code{q} (if \code{q == NULL}), see \code{\link{getCritVal}}. Its choice is a trade-off between data fit and parsimony of the estimator. In other words, this argument balances the risks of missing changes and detecting additional artefacts}
\item{sd}{a single positive numeric giving the standard deviation (noise level) \eqn{\sigma_0}{sigma0} of the data points before filtering, by default (NULL) estimated by \code{\link{sdrobnorm}} with \code{lag = filter$len + 1L}}
\item{startTime}{a single numeric giving the time at which recording (sampling) of \code{data} started, sampling time points will be assumed to be \code{startTime + seq(along = data) / filter$sr}}
\item{output}{a string specifying the return type, see \cite{Value}}
\item{...}{additional parameters to be passed to \code{\link{getCritVal}}. \code{\link{getCritVal}} will be called automatically (if \code{q == NULL}), the number of data points \code{n = length(data)} will be set, the \code{family = "jules"} will be set and \code{alpha} and \code{filter} will be passed. For these parameter no user interaction is required and possible, all other parameters of \code{\link{getCritVal}} can be passed additionally}
}

\value{
The reconstruction (fit) obtained by the detection step of \acronym{JULES}. If \code{output == "onlyFit"} an object object of class \code{\link{stepblock}} containing the fit. If \code{output == "everything"} a \code{\link{list}} containing the entries \code{fit} with the fit, \code{stepfit} with the fit before postfiltering, \code{q} with the given / computed critical value, \code{filter} with the given filter and \code{sd} with the given / estimated standard deviation.

\section{Storing of Monte-Carlo simulations}{
If \code{q == NULL} a Monte-Carlo simulation is required to compute the critical value. Since a Monte-Carlo simulation lasts potentially much longer (up to several hours or days if the number of observations is in the millions) than the main calculations, multiple possibilities for saving and loading the simulations are offered. Progress of a simulation can be reported by the argument \code{messages} which can be specified in \code{\dots} and is explained in the documentation of \code{\link{getCritVal}}. Each Monte-Carlo simulation is specific to the number of observations and the used filter. But note that also Monte-Carlo simulations for a (slightly) larger number of observations \eqn{n_q}{nq}, given in the argument \code{nq} in \code{\dots} and explained in the documentation of \code{\link{getCritVal}}, can be used, which avoids extensive resimulations for only a little bit varying number of observations, but results in a (small) loss of power. However, simulations of type \code{"vectorIncreased"}, i.e. objects of class \code{"MCSimulationMaximum"} with \code{nq} observations, have to be resimulated if \code{as.integer(log2(n1)) != as.integer(log2(n2))} when the saved simulation was computed with \code{n == n1} and the simulation now is required for \code{n == n2} and \code{nq >= n1} and \code{nq >= n2}. Simulations can either be saved in the workspace in the variable \code{critValStepRTab} or persistently on the file system for which the package \code{\link[R.cache]{R.cache}} is used. Moreover, storing in and loading from variables and \link[=readRDS]{RDS} files is supported. The simulation, saving and loading can be controlled by the argument \code{option} which can be specified in \code{\dots} and is explained in the documentation of \code{\link{getCritVal}}. By default simulations will be saved in the workspace and on the file system. For more details and for how simulation can be removed see Section \cite{Simulating, saving and loading of Monte-Carlo simulations} in \code{\link{getCritVal}}.
