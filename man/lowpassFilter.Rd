\title{Lowpass filtering}

\description{
Create lowpass filter.
}

\usage{
lowpassFilter(type = c("bessel"), param, sr = 1, len = NULL, shift = 0.5)
\method{print}{lowpassFilter}(x, \dots)
}

\arguments{
\item{type}{a string specifying the type of the filter, currently only Bessel filters are supported}
\item{param}{a \code{\link{list}} specifying the parameters of the filter depending on \code{type}. For \code{"bessel"} the entries \code{pole} and \code{cutoff} have to be specified and no other named entries are allowed. \code{pole} has to be a single integer giving the number of poles (order). \code{cutoff} has to be a single positive numeric not larger than \code{1} giving the normalized cutoff frequency, i.e. the cutoff frequency (in the temporal domain) of the filter divided by the sampling rate}
\item{sr}{a single numeric giving the sampling rate}
\item{len}{a single integer giving the filter length of the truncated and digitised filter, see \cite{Value} for more details. By default (\code{NULL}) chosen such that the autocorrelation function is below \code{1e-3} at \code{len / sr} and all lager lags \code{(len + i) / sr}, with \code{i} a positive integer}
\item{shift}{a single numeric between \code{0} and \code{1} giving a shift for the digitised filter, i.e. kernel and step are obtained at \code{(0:len + shift) / sr} from the corresponding functions}
\item{x}{the object}
\item{\dots}{for generic methods only}
}

\value{
An object of \code{\link{class}} \code{lowpassFilter}, i.e. a \code{\link{list}} that contains
\describe{
\item{\code{"type"}, \code{"param"}, \code{"sr"}, \code{"len"}}{the corresponding arguments}
\item{\code{"kernfun"}}{the kernel function of the filter, obtained as the Laplace transform of the corresponding transfer function}
\item{\code{"stepfun"}}{the step-response of the filter, i.e. the antiderivative of the filter kernel}
\item{\code{"acfun"}}{the autocorrelation function, i.e. the convolution of the filter kernel with itself}          
\item{\code{"truncatedKernfun"}}{the kernel function of the at \code{len / sr} truncated filter, i.e. \code{kernfun} truncated and rescaled such that the new kernel still integrates to \code{1}}
\item{\code{"truncatedStepfun"}}{the step-response of the at \code{len / sr} truncated filter, i.e. the antiderivative of the kernel of the truncated filter}
\item{\code{"truncatedAcfun"}}{the autocorrelation function of the at \code{len / sr} truncated filter, i.e. the convolution of the kernel of the truncated filter with itself}
\item{\code{"kern"}}{the digitised filter kernel normalised to one, i.e. \code{kernfun((0:len + shift) / sr) / sum(kernfun((0:len + shift) / sr))}}
\item{\code{"step"}}{the digitised step-response of the filter, i.e. \code{stepfun((0:len + shift) / sr)}}
\item{\code{"acf"}}{the discrete autocorrelation, i.e. \code{acfun(0:len / sr)}}
